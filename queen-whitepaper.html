⚔️ Queen of the Hill ⚔️
<br>
<br>
An on-chain game built around the first of its kind, the RAGE Protocol on Base.
<br>
<br>
RAGE token address 0xc0df50143EA93AeC63e38A6ED4E92B378079eA15
<br>
<br>
Here’s how it works:
<br>
🧠 Easy to play — connect wallet — approve — bid — wait for timer to end.
<br>
💰 Biggest total bidder wins the entire pot of RAGE.
<br>
🔥 Every Winning Pot Burns 5% RAGE.
<br>
⏳ Rounds Are Block-Timed — The on-screen timer checks current blocks and resyncs every 10 seconds.
<br>
👑 The winning pot is claimed, tax is burnt, and a new round begins immediately on a new bid.
<br>
❓ If no competeting bid by the end of a round, the lone bidder rolls over to next round.
